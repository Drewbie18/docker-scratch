# Basic Docker Machine Commands

## Create Docker Machine

This will create a docker machine instance running with virualbox. The name of the docker machine in this case is 'vm1'. This is not the docker container running on the machine. At this point this is just a linux box with a docker cli. 

- Command: "docker-machine create --driver virtualbox vm1"
